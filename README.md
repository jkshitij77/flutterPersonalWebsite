Hi this is my personal website
This is my first Flutter Web project



SUPER NECESSARY
My name should disappear sometime
The main thing is responsiveness right now
Life as chapters of books
Put in better animations for text
Find nice colors for the website and change theme
<!-- Fix text overflow using regex in bucket list page -->
